# Swiss Table

A [SIMD-accelerated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) hash table implementation in Swift based off of [Google's Abseil](https://abseil.io/about/design/swisstables) and [Rust's Hashbrown](https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/) that utilizes the AVX2 instruction set to perform fast read/write performance.

Work in progress.
